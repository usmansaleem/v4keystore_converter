# BLS12-381 v4 Keystore converter

Converts BLS12-381 v4 keystore's kdf function parameters. 

This program reads v4 formatted `.json` files from a directory and either a single password file or
matching password file names ending in `.txt` from a directory and converts the kdf function to either
PBKDF2 or SCRYPT. The v4 keystore generated by other tools is typically using SCRYPT with cpu cost parameter `n=262144` 
which makes it very secure but very expensive to compute. By decreasing `n` parameter in SCRYPT or `c` parameter in PBKDF2,
the decryption time can be decreased drastically. The lower the value, the faster the decryption.

The encryption/decryption code is based on [Teku](https://github.com/Consensys/teku/tree/master/infrastructure/bls-keystore)

## Build:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/usmansaleem/v4keystore_converter.git
cd v4keystore_converter
./bld download compile
```

## Run
To convert the v4 keystore [test vectors](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2335.md#scrypt-test-vector)
to pbkdf2 with `c=10`, the usage would be:

```sh
mkdir ./converted

./bld run --args="--src=./testvectors/keys --dest=./converted \
--password-path=./testvectors/passwords \
--kdf-function=PBKDF2 -c=10"
```

Similarly, to convert the test vectors to scrypt with `n=128`, the usage would be:
```sh
./bld run --args="--src=./testvectors/keys --dest=./converted \
--password-path=./testvectors/passwords \
--kdf-function=SCRYPT -n=128"
```

The output would look like:
```
[main] INFO Main - Reading .json paths from ./testvectors/keys
[main] INFO Main - Reading password(s) from ./testvectors/passwords
[main] INFO Main - Decrypting keystores ...
[main] INFO Main - Time taken: 1.065 s
[main] INFO Main - Converting keystores ...
[main] INFO Main - Done. Total Time taken: 1.089 s
```
